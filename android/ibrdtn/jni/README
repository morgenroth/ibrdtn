                        IBR-DTN for Android

How to compile IBR-DTN for Android?
-----------------------------------

   1. Install Android NDK:
      Get latest version of official Android NDK Version (Tested version: 8e)
      from http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html ,
      For old versions see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6849981/where-do-i-find-old-versions-of-ndk

      (For Windows, Cygwin is required)

   2. Add the root directory of the unpacked Android NDK to your PATH variable (http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Umgebungsvariable)
 
   3. Install androgenizer:
      Get androgenizer from http://cgit.collabora.com/git/android/androgenizer.git/
      Build it with "make all"
      Add androgenizer executable to your PATH variable

   4. Install git and swig from your package manager: apt-get install git swig

   5. Run build.sh

   6. OpenSSL (libssl, libcrypto) is compiled as a shared library, but it does not have to be packaged into the APK as it is already included in Android OS.
      We can not include it with LDLIBS as it is not part of the stable API and thus not part of the official Android NDK.

FAQ
---

   o More Android NDK parameters:
     "ndk-build clean" (delete generated libs)
     "ndk-build -B V=1 NDK_DEBUG=1 NDK_LOG=1" (force complete rebuild (-B), showing commands and enable debug and logs from android ndk)
   o Getting an error with "error: invalid conversion from 'void**' to 'JNIEnv** {aka _JNIEnv**}'"
     Update your SWIG installation.

SWIG
----

   o NativeSession.cpp C++ class is wrapped into Java using SWIG. To regenerate Java classes based on NativeSession.cpp run "generate_swig_classes.sh".


Implementation details
----------------------

   o Libraries are cloned from:
     nl-3: https://github.com/dschuermann/libnl
     openssl: https://github.com/guardianproject/openssl-android

   o OpenSSL is compiled but not bundled into the application as we use already existing OpenSSL shared library included in Android OS

   o Androgenizer currently throws away -version-info but not -release, which result in an error, thus we omit libibrcommon_la_LDFLAGS for Android.mk

   o Subdirs are compiled as whole static libraries included in the main static library, they are defined as LOCAL_WHOLE_STATIC_LIBRARIES
     to include all functions even when they are not used.
     Because ibrcommon and ibrdtn share subdirs named the same (e.g. data), we have to prefix those subdir static libs
     to avoid conflicts when compiling with ndk-build

   o Changes to C++ sources:
     ibrcommon/ibrcommon/data/File.cpp
     ibrcommon/ibrcommon/thread/Thread.cpp
     (pthread_attr_setinheritsched not implemented in Android, see https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/android-porting/--xz_KlGZXk
      PAGE_SIZE not defined in Android: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11444169/error-while-compiling-boost-in-android)


Resolve stacktraces
-------------------

   o Symbols are stripped from the compiled binaries, but available under obj/local/armearbi.

   o Android's ndk_stack tool can be used to resolve stack traces logged to logcat by invoking:
     "adb logcat | $ANDROID_NDK/ndk-stack -sym $PROJECT_DIR/android/ibrdtn/obj/local/armeabi/"


Debugging with GDB
------------------

   o Before compiling set debuggable=true in AndroidManifest.xml

   o To start GDB go to ibrdtn project directory and execute "$ANDROID_NDK/ndk-gdb --launch=de.tubs.ibr.dtn.daemon.Preferences --start --force"

   o See $ANDROID_NDK/docs/NDK-GDB.html for more information
