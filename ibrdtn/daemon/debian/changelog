ibrdtnd (0.6.5) stable; urgency=low

  * Common fixes
    * Connection down deletes all static routes
    * Reconnect mechnism tries to connect each second
    * Some shutdown issues
    * Extension block discard issue
  
  * Connection up now triggers all routing modules to look for bundles to transfer
  * Disable autoconnect feature if not specified
  * CBHE and group support for internal apps
  * Configurable parallel event processing
    Set the "-t" parameter on daemon startup to enable this feature.
 
  * Extended API
    * Plain text API for clients
    * Some management routines
    * Event / Log dumping
    * Add and remove IP addresses dynamically via API for non-netlink systems
   
  * File Convergence Layer added. Use the USB Key as intermittent node!
  * New LoWPAN CL architecture - Multiple connections, larger bundles and discovery

ibrdtnd (0.6.4) stable; urgency=low

  * Support for the Scope Control Hop Limit Block added
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fall-dtnrg-schl-00
    (uses extension block id 199 since id 9 is already reserved by BSP)
  * TLS for TCP convergence layer by Stephen Röttger
  * New API framework (supports Groups)
  * SQLiteStorage provides own BLOBs and uses hard-links to copy bundle payload
  * SQLiteStorage expiration fix
  * Disable tcp linger and keepalive option on tcp connections
  * Now IPND binds on any interface instead on the broadcast/multicast address
  * Retransmission Module: Exponential back-off fix
  * Now a transfer is aborted if the node is gone
  * Renamed CONN_ZIGBEE to CONN_LOWPAN

ibrdtnd (0.6.2) stable; urgency=low

  * New features
    * Experimental support for compressed bundle payload
    * Bundle-in-Bundle support based on
      http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-dtnrg-bundle-encapsulation-06
    * Added AgeBlock support to the SQLiteBundleStorage
    * HTTPConvergenceLayer by Robert Heitz
    * Define a logfile in the configuration with "logfile"
    * Define a username with "user"
    * Define user id and group id with "uid" and "gid"
	
  * Improvements
    * Neighbor handling reworked
    * Improved connection termination for API and TCP-CL for more stability
    
  * Fixes
    * Epidemic routing combined with sqlite leads to 100% cpu usage
    * Bundles are not retransmitted after a failed connection
    * Failed TCPCL connections stay unconnected forever
    * Logging to files
