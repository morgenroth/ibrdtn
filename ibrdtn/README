### required and optional packages ###

To build the all IBR-DTN packages from GIT, you need to install some packages.
With this command you could install all required and optional packages. 

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libz-dev libsqlite3-dev \
  libcurl4-gnutls-dev libdaemon-dev automake autoconf pkg-config libtool libcppunit-dev \
  libnl-3-dev libnl-cli-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-nf-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev libarchive-dev \
  libarchive-dev

optional:
  libttfs (not a package, sources at http://code.google.com/p/tffs-lib/)

### Compilation with debugging symbols ###

The old "--enable-debug" option has been removed. To compile the whole
code with debugging symbols use the additional CXXFLAGS with configure.

./configure CXXFLAGS="-ggdb"
make
